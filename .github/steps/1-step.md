## Step 1: Introduction to AI Actions

Welcome to the world of AI-powered automation! You're about to learn how to supercharge your GitHub Actions workflows with artificial intelligence.

### üìñ Theory: AI in GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions can integrate with AI models through the GitHub Models service, which provides access to various AI models via the inference API at `https://models.github.ai/inference`. The built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used to authorize calls to this service, eliminating the need for additional API keys or authentication setup.

Key concepts to understand:

- The `models: read` permission grants the `GITHUB_TOKEN` access to GitHub Models inference API for making AI requests
- You can interact with GitHub Models in multiple ways:
  - **Direct API calls** using `curl` with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` for custom implementations
  - **GitHub CLI extension** (`gh models`) for command-line AI interactions
  - **Ready-to-use GitHub Actions** like `actions/ai-inference` for workflow integration
  - **Custom Actions** that you build for scenario-specific AI workflows
- For this exercise, we'll use the `actions/ai-inference` action as it provides the simplest integration path
- AI in workflows is most useful for tasks requiring content analysis, text processing, and intelligent decision-making
- For deterministic operations like file manipulation or environment setup, regular actions remain more appropriate
- The `actions/ai-inference` action supports both inline prompts and system prompts for controlling AI behavior

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Create Your First AI Workflow

1. Create a new workflow file `.github/workflows/ask-ai.yml`
1. Set up the workflow with `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual testing
1. Configure the job with `models: read` permission
1. Add a step using `actions/ai-inference@v2` with a simple prompt asking "What is the meaning of life?"
1. Display the AI response using `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` to create a nicely formatted output
1. Commit and push your workflow file

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Test Your AI Workflow

1. Navigate to the Actions tab in your repository
1. Find the "Ask AI" workflow and click "Run workflow"
1. Trigger the workflow manually and wait for it to complete
1. Check the workflow run summary to see the AI's response displayed

<summary>Having trouble? ü§∑</summary><br/>

- Make sure you've set the `models: read` permission in your workflow
- Check that you're using the correct action name: `actions/ai-inference@v2`
- Verify your workflow file is in the correct location: `.github/workflows/ask-ai.yml`
- If the workflow doesn't appear in the Actions tab, check for YAML syntax errors
